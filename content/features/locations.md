With IoThings, you can manage different sources of locations.

# GPS Locations
You can send a location 

# Wifi Locations


# Sigfox Spot'It TDoA Locations
This type of location is automatically created with the Spot'it service, and it's dedicated Sigfox Callback, that will send you coarse locations (based on TDoA: Time Difference of Arrival of Sigfox Signals).

In short, this will allow you to have a point and an estimation of where your object is within a radius.

# Sigfox Atlas WiFi Locations
This type of location is automatically created with the Atlas service , and it's dedicated Sigfox Callback.
